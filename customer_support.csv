I did not receive the password reset email. What should I do?,"If you did not receive the password reset email, first verify that you entered the correct email address during the reset process. Check your spam, junk, or promotions folders, as automated emails are sometimes filtered. Ensure that your email provider is not blocking messages from our domain. If you have requested multiple reset emails in a short time, please wait a few minutes before trying again. If the issue persists, contact our support team so we can manually assist you."
Why am I unable to log in even though my credentials are correct?,"If you are unable to log in despite using the correct credentials, the issue may be related to account lockout, browser cache, or temporary server issues. First, try clearing your browser cache and cookies or logging in using a different browser or device. Make sure that Caps Lock is not enabled when entering your password. If you recently changed your password, ensure you are using the updated one. If the problem continues, your account may be temporarily locked for security reasons, and you should contact support."
How can I update my email address associated with the account?,"To update your email address, log in to your account and navigate to the account settings or profile section. Locate the email address field and enter your new email address. You may be asked to verify the new email by clicking on a confirmation link sent to it. Until the new email is verified, your old email address will remain active. If you no longer have access to the old email address, please contact support for manual verification."
